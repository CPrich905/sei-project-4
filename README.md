# # SEI - 41 - FINAL PROJECT
## Brief
Our final project was an opportunity to showcase our abilities so far. We had the option to work in pairs or in groups with a focus on quality code over  quantity.

## Technical Requirements
An ERD diagram showing relationships between models and a basic front-end wireframe/plan of how you will consume and display the data was required for the sign off.
* The end-state must be a full-stack application making your own backend and your own front-end
* Use a PYTHON FLASK API to serve data from a Postgres SQL database
* Consume API with a separate front-end built with React
* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Deliverables
A working app hosted on the internet
A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A readme.md file with:
An embedded screenshot of the app
Explanations of the technologies used
A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
Installation instructions for any dependencies
Link to your user stories/wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
Link to your pitch deck/presentation – documentation of your wireframes, user stories, and proposed architecture
Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome

## My Approach
For my final project, I decided to create an easy to use recipe sharing platform inspired by the excellent cooks in my family and loosely based on the  [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/)  website.

I began by considering the features I wanted to include:
	* An initial database of recipes visible to all users.
	* Users to be able to register and create a profile.
	* Registered users can
		*  CRUD new recipes.
		* save recipes to their profile
		* create a shopping list from recipes. Individual ingredients can be added/removed.
		* Profile to include a store cupboard of common ingredients.
	* /Recipes to be referenced by cuisine and tag - not currently a feature./

This dictated the datatypes I would need to include in my recipe schema and the relationship tables I would need to build between recipes and users.


## Future development
styling
search by cuisine/tag
allow users to submit cuisines/tags
users to suggest tags, chefs to approve
price check through Tesco API
follow chefs
family/friend/cuisine groups
## Major hurdles
